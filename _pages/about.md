<p>I am a Machine Learning/Deep Learning Enthusiast and a hardcore Linux guy. I am an Electronics an Communications Engineering udergrad at the Institute of Engineering & Management, Kolkata. Passionate about Computer Vision and NLP, I quite enjoyed my time at the Signals and Image Processing Lab, IIT KGP under Prof. Dr. Debdoot Sheet where I picked up on applying adverserial Learning techniques on Biomedical Imaging problems. I have a publication at ICASSP, 2019 on Video Generation which can be found <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8682158">here</a>! </p>

<p>Other than all that and programming , I love football, badminton and occassionally fall for volleyball and table tennis(unsuccessfully XD). For a bit more of a formal Introduction, do check below!</p>
