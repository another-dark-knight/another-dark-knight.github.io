  There are very few things out there that I love more than Linux. I have been a <b>serious</b> linux user for the past 8 years or so. From distro hopping to debugging to experimenting with init-systems and comapring them, I have come to understand that my ideal Linux setup is so very different from yours. This section of the blog shall deal with some exciting things I do in linux and BSD enviornments including setting up different applications, some of which may be available in Windows but their setups may vary.
<br><br>
The blogs in this section shall not be categorized or ordered and shall be independent, discrete posts.
