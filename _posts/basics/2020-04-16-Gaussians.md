The curves given above are known as Gaussians. This post aims to discuss what they are, what they mean and to gain intuitive intuitions into what they signify. We shall further learn to hallucinate sample points from such curves and look at what likelihood means. These concepts are fundamental to machine learning and statistics in general.

Networks such as Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) depend on these fundamental concepts and one shouldn't dive into such networks without first understanding these concepts and gain an insight into randomness and information.
